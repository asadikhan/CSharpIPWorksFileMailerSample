## How to get gmail password for MFA 

When MFA is enabled, the password you use to log into the gmail account is not the one you need to use in ipWorks configuration. This needs to be the app password you generated by following these steps. 

- Go to your Google Account settings (https://myaccount.google.com/).
- Navigate to the "Security" section.
- Under "Signing in to Google", click on "App passwords".
- Select "Mail" from the dropdown list and "Other (Custom name)" if available, then click "Generate".
- Copy the generated password and use it in the appsettings.config above.
